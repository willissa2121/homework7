# Homework7
##Train Scheduler
For this Assignment, the website will containt two cards. The first card lists the train name, destination, frequency, time until next arrival, and the next time (12hr clock) the train is in the station based on the user input first train time and user input train frequency. The user input is stored in a firebase database, and the body of the table is dynamically generated by checking each child element of the databse and displaying the stored data as called. If a user input does not match the correct paramters, an error message will display beneath the submit button for 2 seconds, and will empty all search fields.
